# ComputeShadersPerlinNoise
Perlin noise on Compute shaders unity

Running perlin noise directly in the compute shader and printing resulting texture directly to the main camera.

I didn't port the noise functions to hlsl, simplexNoise.cginf file from https://forum.unity.com/threads/2d-3d-4d-optimised-perlin-noise-cg-hlsl-library-cginc.218372/
